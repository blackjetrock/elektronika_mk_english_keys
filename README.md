# English Keys for the Elektronika MK-52 and MK-61

English keys for the Elektronika MK 52 and MK61.
The keys come on a sprue, cut them off but keep the flanges on each long side. these hold the keys into the keyframe.
I fill the legend with white air dry clay, but other methods might work.

To generate the STL files, set the appropriate ksn variable at the top of the scad file, then render with F5. F6 and then save the STL file to a filename ending in 'n'.
Repeat for all the key sets, then send the stl files to a 3D printer or manufacturing company.
